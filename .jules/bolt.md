## 2024-05-24 - Nested Component Defintions and Full Remounts
**Learning:** React components defined inside other components (e.g., `TaskRow` defined inside `DashboardPage`) are completely unmounted and remounted on every parent render because React sees them as entirely new component types each time. This destroys DOM state and leads to severe performance degradation, especially for list items that map over large arrays.
**Action:** Always extract inner component definitions to the top level (outside of the parent component body). Pass any needed parent scope variables as props, and wrap the extracted list items in `React.memo` for further optimization.

**Learning:** React re-renders list items in search results every time the query changes or an item is selected by keyboard arrows.
**Action:** Wrap search result components in `React.memo`.
